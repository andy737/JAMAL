<p><acronym>JAMAL</acronym> (JAva MAtlab Linking) is an open source, Java RMI-based (Java Remote Method Invocation API)
    tool that makes it possible to call Matlab functions from Java programs.

<p><em>MATLAB</em>&nbsp;is a high-level technical computing language containing a lot of libraries. JAMAL can be helpful
    in the cases, when one needs to make use of some functionality that already exists in Matlab environment without
    writing great deal of java code.
<p>JAMAL consists of two parts: server part and client part. JAMAL server can be run inside Matlab installation on a
    network host and used by several machines inside the network. All calls from java use remote method invocation and
    there is no need to store the output of Matlab function in a temporary file with consecutive reading it from Java
    program.
<p>This tool can be recommended to researches that extensively use Java and Matlab in their activities.
